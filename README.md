Artificial Intelligence Code Samples ( Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning,... )

Here are some Python and Matlab code samples of supervised/unsupervised methods for beginers. Clustering, Neural Networks/ Deep Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning samples are implemented from scrach or using variety of related libraries.
